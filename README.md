## Communication Between Components

### Front-End and Back-End
- **HTTP/HTTPS Requests:** The front-end communicates with the back-end via secure HTTP protocols using RESTful APIs or GraphQL.
- **WebSockets:** Real-time communication for notifications, messaging, and collaboration features.
- **GraphQL:** Flexible querying capabilities for efficient data retrieval.

### Back-End and Modeling Engine
- **Foreign Function Interface (FFI):** Rust back-end calls Julia functions directly for executing complex simulations and computations.
- **gRPC:** High-performance RPC framework for language-agnostic communication between back-end services and the modeling engine.

### Back-End and Database
- **Database Drivers:** Rust back-end utilizes SurrealDB client libraries to interact with the database.
- **Graph Queries:** Leveraging SurrealDB’s native graph querying capabilities for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

### Authentication and Security
- **JWT Tokens:** JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication between the front-end and back-end.
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect:** Secure authentication and authorization flows.

## Setup Instructions
